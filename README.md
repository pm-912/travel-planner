## Installation
Node.js and Express.js to create a Restful API, Handlebars.js as the template engine, Mysql and Sequelize ORM for the database. Faker is our new technology that we used and finally Express-session for authentication.

## Usage
When you arrive at our homepage and want to plan a trip or view any trips. You are prompted to signup or login. Once logged in you are brought to the public trips page were you can view public trips and get ideas on where youd like to plan your next getaway. Once you have decided on a destination you can plan a trip where you can add where you are going, for when you leave, how long youre staying, a description of your trip and your planned accommodations. Once you have added your trip then you can review it in your saved trips by clicking into it and reviewing your trip details. You can then add it to the public trips to have other users comment on different attractions, restaurants and other activities for that area you are traveling to.
